		<h3>About Me:</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Hello, my name is Moos! I'm a professional 3D character/creature artist, content creator, beginner game developer, and horror fanatic obsessed with all things weird and spooky.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h4>Artist:</h4>
		<p>I specialize in 3D animation, horror art, and creature design in a variety of styles from realistic to low-poly. However, I also love to experiment with a variety of other mediums and genres of work to branch out and learn new things.</p>
		<br><br>
		<h4>Content Creator:</h4>
		<p>Under the brand name <i>MisspelledMoos</i>, I work with game developers, publishers, and PR agents to create high-quality coverage for indie games. With the mantra of "Weird n' Spooky," my goal as a creator is to shed a light on weird and obscure indie games that I find interesting and enjoyable. For the creation of this content, I write my own scripts, record footage, record and mix voiceovers, and edit the final production together.
		<br><br>
		My most notable series on YouTube are <i>You Should Play</i>, in which I explain to great lengths why people should play the subject game of each video, and my <i>Demo Dive</i> series, where I compile curated lists of demos for upcoming indie games and talk about my experiences with them. These YouTube videos also feature small (1-10 second) animations featuring my Moos character model. On top of my video content, I also livestream on YouTube and Twitch with my built-from-scratch 3D VTuber model.</p>
